"Dear Myself: If you can't find your glasses in here... well ok that isn't too surprising. You may be a bit dense, but you're consistent. 
You've never lost your glasses in here, honestly I'm surprised you even listened to the last notebook entry in the first place. 
Anyway, I know you can't see much right now, but I'm feeling sadistic and am gonna make these hints less obvious from here on out. Think of it like a game, yeah?
Your glasses lie in one of three, but which room is next for thee? Take a gander, if you dare, in the room of a perfect square."
