So, you've lost your glasses again, huh? Oh boy, aren't you forgetful. Alright, press SPACE and I'll tell you what to do.
It looks like your scatterbrained self predicted this would happen, since you left a couple of notebooks lying around the house with some clues. Just walk on top of them to read them.
Right... I forgot you're as blind as a bat at the moment. Ah well, wandering aimlessly never hurt anyone before, right? Just don't ram into any furniture.
Also don't bother going downstairs, there's no point in trying to leave without your sight. Welp, good luck.
